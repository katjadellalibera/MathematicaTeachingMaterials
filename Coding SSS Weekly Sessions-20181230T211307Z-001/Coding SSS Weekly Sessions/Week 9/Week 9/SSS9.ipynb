    "*BACK STORY: Throughout this section we will work on a problem adapted from [this blog](http://corysimon.github.io/articles/by-how-many-flights-should-an-airline-overbook/). You are highly encouraged to work through the example in that article in your own time as it is a good problem that puts all of the concepts we learn in this unit into practice (probability, expected value, binomial distribution, conditional probability, etc.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a nonzero probability that travellers will miss their booked flight due to missed connections or other situations. Given that, consider an airplane with 100 seats. If the airline sells 100 tickets but fewer than 100 passengers show up, the airline incurs an opportunity cost of lost revenue from the no-show customers. Therefore, the airline actually wants to overbook the flight. However, if it overbooks by too much and more than 100 passengers show up, it must fork out costly vouchers and hotel rooms to the passengers that get bumped from the flight, which decreases revenue. **By how many cutomers should the airplane overbook?** We will not answer this big question in this session, but we will partly analyze the decision of selling 120 tickets. We'll come back to this problem next week.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The SciPy Library\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this problem in Python we'll import the SciPy library for scientific computing. Note that we'll use the [scipy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/stats.html) package extensively throughout the FA statistics unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before exploring what we can do with `scipy.stats`, let's recall that we've seen this library already when we had to compute the mode of a list. Fill in the cell below to print the mode of list A."
