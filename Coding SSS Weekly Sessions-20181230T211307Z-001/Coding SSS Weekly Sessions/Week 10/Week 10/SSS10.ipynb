    "Consider an airplane with 100 seats. If the airline sells 100 tickets but fewer than 100 passengers show up, the airline incurs an opportunity cost of lost revenue from the no-show customers. Therefore, the airline actually wants to overbook the flight. However, if it overbooks by too much and more than 100 passengers show up, it must fork out costly vouchers and hotel rooms to the passengers that get bumped from the flight, which decreases revenue. **By how many customers should the airplane overbook?** We will give a complete answer to this question in this section by computing the **maximum expected value of the revenue**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from last week that if the airline overbooks 20 tickets (meaning they sell 120 tickets in total), we can model the probability that a certain number of customers will show as a binomial distribution. Suppose that for each customer, the probability they he/she will show up is 90%, then the probability that exactly 100 customers will show can be computed as follows:"
