    "Tonight, Santa is bringing special early gifts to the 10 kids he thinks are the most well-behaved. He has 4 types of gifts (let's index them 1, 2, 3, and 4). When he meets each kid, he will select a gift of random type to give them. The kid may accept or decline the gift. When the kid declines, he has to randomly select a gift of the other types that have not been offered, and continues to do so until the kid accepts the gift. For the first offer, there is a 50/50 chance of the kid accepting. For the later offers, the kid will accept the gift if it is of higher index than the previous offer (for example, the kid will immediately accept gift 3 if the previous offer was gift 1), and decline otherwise. Additionally, the kid has to accept the 4th offer if it gets no matter what. Estimate by simulation the expected number of kids that accept a gift *within 2 offers* (1 or 2). Also, produce a graph that records the number of kids that accept a gift within 2 offers in each iteration of your simulation. "
