    "Besides having code that works correctly, it is important to keep your code readable by following some established guideline on conventions. Check out [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), a guide on conventions in Python code. You are encouraged to look at the document in your own time. In this session, we want to highlight two areas in style guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A.1.1 White space in a function call**\n",
    "\n",
    "We noticed that some students put a white space immediately before the open parenthesis that starts the argument list of a function call. For example, a print statement is put as\n",
    "\n",
    "`print (3)`,\n",
    "\n",
    "instead of `print(3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While works fine practically speaking, it is a pet peeve according to PEP 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same convention applies for slicing and indexing: we should not put any whitespace immediately before the open bracket that starts an indexing or slicing. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes: `list_a[2] = list_a[3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "No: `list_a [2] = list_a [3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A.1.2 Variable naming conventions**\n",
    "\n",
    "For function and variable names, PEP 8 recommends:\n",
    "* Never use the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names, as in some fonts they are indistinguishable from 0 (zero) and 1 (one).\n",
    "* Function names and variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although not mentioned in the style guide, it is good practice to name your variables in an informing and meaningful way. For example, the following is a possible excerpt from code for the racket-ball simulation preclass-work:"
